# Generational — Pipeline Specification (v8.1)

The complete future flow of the AI Content Operating System. Live stages run
today; future stages are wired into the orchestrator and skip cleanly until
their engines report ready. **This ordering is the contract** — changing it
requires Agent 1 review of `core/workflows.py` and
`services/orchestrator/stages.py`.

## Rules

1. **One data model.** Every stage reads and writes the canonical
   `ContentPackage` / `ProductionPackage` (see `DATA_CONTRACTS.md`). During
   intelligence stages the shared `context` dict carries state; the packager
   folds it into packages at the end. Future stages receive packages.
2. **No stage calls another stage.** This is Architecture Directive #1 —
   Orchestrator-Only Communication (`ARCHITECTURE_DIRECTIVES.md`), enforced
   by `tests/test_architecture.py`. The orchestrator
   (`services/orchestrator/`) sequences everything; engines communicate only
   through context/package fields declared in their contracts.
3. **Statuses.** Every stage returns SUCCESS, WARNING, FAILED, or SKIPPED
   plus diagnostics (`StageReport`). A FAILED stage stops the pipeline
   gracefully; a not-ready future stage yields WARNING/SKIPPED and the run
   continues.
4. **Quality Gate is the safety boundary.** Nothing reaches Render or
   Publishing with `publish_ready=False` unless a human explicitly overrides.
5. **Additive evolution.** New stages are added via
   `register_stage()` / `WORKFLOWS`; new fields are appended to the
   ContentPackage; nothing existing is removed or renamed.
6. **Render stage invocation.** The render stage is live but runs on
   demand: `get_orchestrator().run_render_stage(result.context)` after a
   full pipeline run. It renders every idea in the context (mock render
   today), writes each `render_package`, and mirrors the results into
   `context["unified_packages"]` (status → `rendered`). With nothing to
   render it returns a safe SKIPPED summary — never a failure.
7. **SEO stage invocation.** The seo stage is live and runs on demand:
   `get_orchestrator().run_seo_stage(context)` after render. It optimizes
   every publish-ready item (preferring `unified_packages`, falling back
   to `ideas`), enriches each `seo_package` additively (base refinement
   metadata is never overwritten), and emits `seo_optimization_report` +
   `publishing_packages` (standardized PublishingPackage v1.0 per item —
   the handover to Agent 7; the ContentPackage `publishing_package` slot
   stays Agent 7's to write). With nothing to optimize it reports zero
   items — never a failure.
8. **Publish stage invocation.** The publish stage is live and runs on
   demand: `get_orchestrator().run_publish_stage(context)` after seo. The
   `scheduler` engine emits `publish_schedule` (timezone-aware slots from
   the Optimization Engine's ranked windows); the `publishing` engine
   builds one platform publish package per item × platform through the
   provider adapters, queues retry-capable PublishingJobs, executes due
   jobs (mock publish today), writes each ContentPackage
   `publishing_package` slot (status → `scheduled` / `published`), and
   returns a standardized PublishingResult on `publishing_result`. With
   nothing to publish it reports SKIPPED — never a failure.
